Lead Scoring Case Study
Problem Statement
X Education faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate of around 30%. The company receives a large number of leads, but not all of them convert into paying customers. The goal is to improve this conversion rate by identifying the "Hot Leads," which are the leads most likely to convert into customers. By focusing on these potential leads, X Education can optimize its sales efforts and improve efficiency.

The task is to build a logistic regression model that will assign a lead score to each lead. This score will range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion (Hot Lead) and a lower score indicates a lower likelihood of conversion (Cold Lead).

Project Goal
The project goal is to create a lead scoring system for Lead X that will:
1. Assign a score from 0 to 100 to each lead.
2. Facilitate the identification of high-potential leads.
3. Support the company's objective of increasing their lead conversion rate to 80%.
